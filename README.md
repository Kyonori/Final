Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we included a small hello world application.

1) Open the hello-world.html file

2) Click on the Preview button to open a live preview pane

3) Make some changes to the file, save, watch the preview, and have fun!

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team
